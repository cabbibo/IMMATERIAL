# IM || MATERIA


Hey there, and thanks for making it this far! IM || MATERIA is a project that I've been thinking about / creating for quite some time, that is something between a library, a kid's book, an explorable explanation, a game, and an album.

## The Project

At its core IM || MATERIA is a story about a young woman who discovers a strange island, learning and growing with the different Flora and Fauna she discovers there.

If you want to know more about the creative background of the projectt, [Check Out The Pitch Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1t_GDcywBhv5xwdnXLVdzqWYZ1g42wRB_-O82VhaUCSk/edit?usp=sharing/). Alot of the concept / aesthetics have changed since then, but you can get a decent idea of what the project is.

However, with any digital project, there is hidden world of code that is the DNA of the experience, and I want to experiment with how form can reflect content through the veneer of the application itself into the process of creation itself.

If this sounds too 'poetic' for a Git-Hub readme, good. I for one am tired of code, science, mathematics and engineering being so rigid, so static, and so lifeless. 

That being said, I am going to do my **ABSOLUTE BEST** to keep my code clean and readable, even if the class names are things like 'God' and 'Lifeform' and the function names things like, 'Become' and 'EnterTheAbyss' .


## Change
I've been thinking about this project since before ENOUGH, and it has changed/morphed more times than I can count. That being said, I feel confident enough, that this iteration is when I'd like to develop more publicly. 

That doesn't mean I'm not going to fail or change everything about the story, or change everything about the engine, or decide to write it in webgl instead of unity or 1 of 100000 other possible outcomes. Please bear with me, and hopefully if you learn nothing else from the project, you'll know its OK to fail!

## DANGER
There is one big problem with doing this sort of development in the open, which is that to experience a project for its first time in its final form is dramatically different then following its whole development. I am both trying to create a story that will hopefully be dynamic enough that spoilers will matter, and am creating it in the open. 

Because of this, I am going to do my *absolute best* to not spoil the story itself, but as I have no idea what I'm doing I can't garuntee it. If you don't want spoilers, just ignore this project and its progression until it is released! ( Hopefully within the next two years? )

## Funding
This project is currently funded from doing way to many contract projects, stressing myself to half death, burning out and then getting to work on the project for a few weeks before I start the cycle again! 

That being said, I have a dream of being able to focus on this project full time. The two options for doing this finding a publisher , and running a patreon!

If you want to help with either of these options, please reach out to me, or [consider donating to my patreon](https://www.patreon.com/cabbibo)




## Structure
This will also be changing constantly, but for now, You will find the following sections below:
  - Tutorials / Code Writeups : For those of you who want to play with the library!
  - Concepts / Inspirations : For those of you who want to know more about the story!
  - Code: This will eventually contain a 'real' code readme / getting started, but since I'm already trying to do way too much, it will likely come a bit later!
  - TODO: If you are interested in whats coming next!
